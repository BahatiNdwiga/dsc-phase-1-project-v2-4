#### Project Overview
+ Microsoft has decided to enter the movie industry by establishing a new movie studio. However, since they lack experience in the entertainment industry, producing high-quality, original movies that appeal to a wide audience presents a significant challenge. The primary goal of this project is to overcome this lack of experience and create a successful movie studio that produces high-quality movies that appeal to a wide audience.

#### Problem Statement
+ The problem statement for this project is that Microsoft lacks expertise in the entertainment industry, and as such, they need to identify the right talent, create a business plan, and establish relationships with distributors and other stakeholders to produce and distribute high-quality, original movies. The company needs to ensure that the movies appeal to a wide audience and generate revenue for the company. Failure to overcome this lack of experience could result in the production of low-quality movies that fail to generate revenue, negatively impacting the company's reputation and financial performance.

#### Objectives
+ The following objectives were identified for the project:

+ Successfully enter the entertainment industry by producing high-quality original movies
+ Create a sustainable and profitable business model for the movie studio that aligns with Microsoft's overall corporate strategy and objectives
+ Establish a reputable and successful movie studio that contributes to Microsoft's overall growth and success

#### Questions to Answer
+ The following questions will be answered in the project:

+ What is the relationship between the production budget and the gross revenue?
+ What is the return on investment (ROI) for the movies produced?
+ What are the most popular movie genres?

#### Data Extraction
+ The following datasets were used in this project:

+ Bom Movie Gross Data
+ Movie Budgets Data

#### Data Cleaning
+ The datasets were cleaned to ensure that they were ready for analysis. The cleaning process involved checking for duplicates and missing values. Depending on the number of missing values, we either dropped the rows containing the missing values or grouped the entire column if the missing values were too many. We kept the first row and dropped the rest of the duplicates.

#### Conclusion
+ This project aimed to help Microsoft create a successful movie studio by providing insights on the relationship between the production budget and gross revenue, ROI, and popular movie genres. The project used Bom Movie Gross Data and Movie Budgets Data to derive these insights. By identifying the right talent, creating a business plan, and establishing relationships with distributors and other stakeholders, Microsoft can produce and distribute high-quality, original movies that appeal to a wide audience, generating revenue for the company and contributing to its overall growth and success.
